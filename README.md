## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This
I’m committing to 100 days of consistent coding — no excuses, no breaks.  
The goal: build real Python fundamentals, sharpen problem-solving skills, and grow as an engineer every day.

## 🗂️ Progress Tracker
- [x] Day 1 – Python Basics + Band Name Generator
- [x] Day 2 - Understanding data types and how to manipulate strings.
- [x] Day 3 - Control flow with if/else and conditional operators 
- [x] Day 4 - Practiced random number generation using the `random` module
- [ ] Day 100

Every day gets its own folder with:
- Notes (`notes.md`)
- Code (`.py` files)
- Wins & challenges

## 📚 Course I'm Following
I’m working through the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp** by Dr. Angela Yu.
