# Day 4 – Randomisation and Rock-Paper-Scissors

## What I Learned Today

### Randomisation
- Using the `random` module
- `random.randint(a, b)` to generate random integers
- Using lists + indexes to select random items

### Lists
- Lists store multiple values in a single variable
- Accessing items using indexes (`my_list[0]`)
- Creating lists of ASCII art for easy selection

### Input Validation
- Ensuring user input is inside a valid range (0–2)
- Ending the program early using `exit()`

### Game Logic
- Using if/elif/else to compare player choices
- Understanding win conditions:
  - Paper beats Rock  
  - Rock beats Scissors  
  - Scissors beat Paper  
- Handling ties

### Clean Code Practices
- Organizing ASCII art at the top
- Making a list for easy mapping between numbers and art
- Printing user & computer choices before determining winner
