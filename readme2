Bet — I’m going to rebuild your **entire README.md** from scratch so it looks like a clean, professional, portfolio-ready project that hiring managers immediately respect.

This README will:

* introduce your 100 Days of Code journey
* show your progress in a clean table
* link each day to its folder
* explain what you're learning as a cloud/AI engineer
* look like a serious developer repo

Copy/paste this into your root:

# 100 Days of Code – Python Bootcamp Progress

This repository tracks my journey through the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**.  
Each day includes:
- A focused lesson  
- Notes summarizing what I learned  
- A project applying the new concepts  

This repo documents my growth in **Python, problem-solving, logic, and software fundamentals** as I build toward cloud, AI, and security engineering.

## Progress Overview

| Day | Topic / Focus | Notes | Project |
|-----|----------------|--------|----------|
| 01 | Printing, input, variables | [Notes](day01/notes.md) | [Band Name Generator](day01/band_name_generator.py) |
| 02 | Data types, math, type conversion | [Notes](day02/notes.md) | Tip Calculator |
| 03 | Conditionals, logical operators, nesting | [Notes](day03/notes.md) | Treasure Island Game |
| 04 | Randomisation, lists, game logic | [Notes](day04/notes.md) | Rock-Paper-Scissors |

*Table updates as I progress through all 100 days.*

## Goals of This Challenge

1. Strengthen Python fundamentals  
2. Build real, working projects  
3. Develop problem-solving skills  
4. Create a public record of improvement  
5. Build discipline through daily coding  
6. Level up toward cloud, AI, and security engineering roles  

---

## How I Work

- Every day includes **clean notes** so I can revisit concepts later.  
- Projects are **simple at first**, then grow more complex.  
- Each lesson reinforces core engineering habits:
  - readable code  
  - input validation  
  - organized structure  
  - logical thinking  
  - debugging and iteration

## About Me

This repo is part of my larger journey to:

- build a professional engineering foundation  
- level up Python skills for cloud + AI work  
- improve problem-solving discipline  
- create a technical portfolio I can show employers

## Updates

This README will expand as I move deeper into the challenge.  
Future additions will include:

- Object-Oriented Programming  
- File handling  
- Exceptions  
- GUIs  
- APIs  
- Data analysis  
- Automation scripts  
- Web development  
- Final portfolio projects  

---

If you want, I can also:

- Add interactive badges (progress, Python version, last commit)  
- Add thumbnails/screenshots for your projects  
- Add direct GitHub links to each script  
- Add a progress bar  
- Add a “Start Here” section  

Just say: **“Add badges”**, **“Add progress bar”**, or **“Make it look advanced.”**
```
